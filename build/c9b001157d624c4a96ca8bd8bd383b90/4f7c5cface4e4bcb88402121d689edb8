ABOUT WARZONE 2100 PORTABLE
==========================
The Warzone 2100 Portable Launcher allows you to run Warzone 2100 from a removable drive whose
letter changes as you move it to another computer.  The application can be entirely self-
contained on the drive and then used on any Windows computer.


LICENSE
=======
This code is released under the GPL.  The full code is included with this package as
Warzone2100Portable.nsi.


INSTALLATION / DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
==================================
By default, the program expects one of these directory structures:

-\ <--- Directory with Warzone2100Portable.exe
	+\App\
		+Warzone 2100\
	+\Data\
		+\settings\

It can be used in other directory configurations by including the Warzone2100Portable.ini
file in the same directory as Warzone2100Portable.exe and configuring it as details in the
INI file section below.


WARZONE2100PORTABLE.INI CONFIGURATION
=====================================
The Warzone 2100 Portable Launcher will look for an ini file called Warzone2100Portable.ini
within its directory (see the Installation/Directory Structure section above for more
details).  If you are happy with the default options, it is not necessary, though.  The
INI file is formatted as follows:

[Warzone2100Portable]
Warzone2100Directory=App\Warzone 2100
SettingsDirectory=Data\settings
Warzone2100Executable=warzone2100.exe
AdditionalParameters=
DisableSplashScreen=false
ScreenHeight=768
ScreenWidth=1024

The Warzone2100Directory and SettingsDirectory entries should be set to the *relative* path
to the directory containing warzone2100.exe and the settings files.  They must be a
subdirectory (or multiple subdirectories) of the directory containing
Warzone2100Portable.exe.  The default entries for these are described in the installation
section above.

The Warzone2100Executable entry allows you to set the Warzone 2100 Portable Launcher to use an
alternate EXE call to launch Warzone 2100.  This is helpful if you are using a machine that
is set to deny warzone2100.exe from running.
You'll need to rename the warzone2100.exe file and then enter the name you gave it on the
Warzone2100Executable= line of the INI.

The AdditionalParameters entry allows you to pass additional commandline parameter
entries to warzone2100.exe.  Whatever you enter here will be appended to the call to
warzone2100.exe.

DisableSplashScreen allows you to disable the splash screen when set to true.

The ScreenHeight and ScreenWidth entries allow you run warzone2100.exe with a certain screen resolution.

PROGRAM HISTORY / ABOUT THE AUTHOR
==================================
This launcher grew out of John T. Haller's work on the Firefox Portable and Thunderbird Portable
projects.  Some of the ideas arose from discussions relating to Firefox Portable &
Thunderbird Portable in the mozillaZine forums.
