Make Sure debug messages show up immediatly
Make PeopleBrowser
-Search list, list looks like facebook chat
-Profile looks like phpBB2
Make Options
-Colors
-Say not much here yet
Setup Admin System
-Privs, button hiding, admin console
DB talk on seperate thread
Encrypted DB talk - low priority
Java 1.6 compatability - HUGE PRIORITY


FIX: Close file handles!!!!
